## Installation üì¶

```sh
npm install --save async-status
```

This assumes that you‚Äôre using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to consume [ES6](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#es6-recommended) or
[CommonJS](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#commonjs) modules.

## Concept üí°

The goal of this package is to provide a unified and standardized representation of asynchronous status.
It helps to integrate other libraries that translate asynchronous state to synchronous state
(for example [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)).
Instead of using different flags like `isLoading`, `isPending`, `hasError`, this library represents asynchronous status
as a one-variable - status.

There are 4 possible statuses:

- `AsyncStatus.IDLE` ‚ö´Ô∏è - means that nothing happens - it's the initial status
- `AsyncStatus.PENDING` ‚è≥ - means that async action is pending
- `AsyncStatus.RESOLVED` ‚úÖ - means that async action has been successfully finished
- `AsyncStatus.REJECTED` ‚ùå - means that an error occurred during async action

There are no constraints about transitions between given statuses.

To give a better understanding of the relationship between `AsyncStatus` and asynchronous code let's try with real code:

```typescript
import AsyncStatus from "async-status";

const state = {
  status: AsyncStatus.IDLE
};

function fetchUsers() {
  state.status = AsyncStatus.PENDING;

  fetch("/api/user")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      state.data = data;
      state.status = AsyncStatus.RESOLVED;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      state.error = error;
      state.status = AsyncStatus.REJECTED;
    });
}

fetchUsers();
```

As you can see, you don't have to introduce any boolean flags like `isPending` üëå

## API reference üìñ

The status is a primitive value - string or undefined.

```typescript
AsyncStatus.IDLE = undefined;
AsyncStatus.PENDING = "PENDING";
AsyncStatus.RESOLVED = "RESOLVED";
AsyncStatus.REJECTED = "REJECTED";
```

#### `AsyncStatus.all(...statuses: AsyncStatus[]): AsyncStatus`

Combines many statuses into one status using an algorithm similar to `Promise.all` method.
Basically the algorithm is:

1.  if statuses list is empty, result = IDLE
2.  if one of the statuses is equal REJECTED, result = REJECTED
3.  if one of statuses is equal PENDING, result = PENDING
4.  if all statuses equal RESOLVED, result = RESOLVED
5.  in other cases, result = IDLE

#### `isAsyncStatus(candidate: any): candidate is AsyncStatus`

Checks if a given candidate is an `AsyncStatus` (means that it's equal `undefined` or `'PENDING'` or `'RESOLVED'` or `'REJECTED'`)

## Typings üìê

If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), typings are provided in the npm package.
This library doesn't provide [Flow](https://flow.org/) typings.
